# moodmusicscript
A lil script that recommends Spotify playlists based on mood (happy, sad, angry, etc.). It offers mood-based suggestions, motivational quotes, and a countdown timer for productivity. The app logs moods with timestamps and integrates with the Spotify API for personalized music recommendations.
Be it a small project, I took a holistic approach to combine my psychological knowledge with my growing knowledge on user experience and programming.
Psychological Foundations
Mood-Task Matching: Research in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Positive Psychology shows that matching tasks with emotional states can improve productivity. For example, during stress, short mindfulness breaks are recommended, while during focused states, more intensive tasks are encouraged.
Music for Emotional Regulation: Music has therapeutic benefits, such as reducing anxiety and improving focus. The app curates playlists based on mood to optimize mental statesâ€”calming music during stress, and motivating tunes during creativity.
Motivational Quotes: The script provides daily motivational quotes to reinforce positive self-talk and increase confidence, backed by self-affirmation theory in psychology.
User Experience Design
Simple Mood Input: The app uses an easy-to-navigate interface where users select their mood, reducing decision fatigue and encouraging quick engagement.
Instant Feedback: Immediate suggestions and recommendations help users transition smoothly to a productive state. This leverages instant gratification to keep users motivated.
Timer Feature: Based on the Pomodoro Technique, the app promotes focused work intervals with breaks, reducing mental fatigue and maintaining productivity.
Conclusion
This app combines psychological insights with technical skills to create a tool that enhances both productivity and mental well-being. By offering mood-based suggestions, music recommendations, and motivational quotes, it ensures users stay focused, balanced, and motivated throughout the day.
